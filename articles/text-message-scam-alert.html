<p><strong>What’s happening:</strong> Consumers across the U.S. are reporting an increase in fake text messages claiming to be from delivery companies. These messages often say a package is delayed or needs confirmation and include a link.</p>

<p>The messages are designed to look urgent and legitimate, frequently using familiar brand names or generic phrases like “delivery issue” or “address problem.”</p>
